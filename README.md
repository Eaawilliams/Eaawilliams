My name is Eric Williams; I've created this repository as a means to upload the code of anything I've worked on.
I'm not a software engineer or anything similar, I'm a chemical engineering graduate with an interest in computers. The main reason for this account is to motivate myself to learn what I wish to know as well as to showcase potential projects.
Currently, these interests are: cryptography/cryptanalysis, game development, and machine learning. I believe machine learning in particular will have broad use in chemical engineering and so will use this account primarily for this purpose.
